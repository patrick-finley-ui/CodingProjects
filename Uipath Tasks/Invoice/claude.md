## Visual Development

### Design Principles
- Comprehensive design checklist in `/context/design-principles.md`

- When making visual (front-end, UI/UX) changes, always refer to these files for guidance

### Quick Visual Check
IMMEDIATELY after implementing any front-end change:
1. **Identify what changed** - Review the modified components/pages
2. **Verify design compliance** - Compare against `/context/design-principles.md` and
3. **Validate feature implementation** - Ensure the change fulfills the user's specific request
4. **Check acceptance criteria** - Review any provided context files or requirements


This verification ensures changes meet design standards and user requirements.
